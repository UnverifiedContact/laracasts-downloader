### Details About Vimeo 

If you using vimeo source, will download 2 files for each episode, a video file and an audio file. 

After all download will be done, the project will merge files and will moving to your respective folder. 

### Using your local machine
1. Install project dependencies:
```sh
$ composer install
```
2. To run a download of all content, run the following command:
```sh
$ php start.php
```
3. See [downloading specific series or lessons](#downloading-specific-series-or-lessons) for optional flags.

### Using Docker
1. Build the image:
```sh
$ docker-compose build
```
2. Install project dependencies:
```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm composer
```
3. Then, run the command of your choice as if we were running it locally, but instead against the docker container:
```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm laracastdl php ./start.php [empty for all OR provide flags]
```
4. See [downloading specific series or lessons](#downloading-specific-series-or-lessons) for optional flags.

Also works in the browser, but is better from the cli because of the instant feedback.

## Options

### Disable Scrapping

The script scraps each Laracasts pages and caches them to memories its latest state
and stores them in ``Downloads/cache.php``. If you already make sure this file is updated
and do not want to experience impatience of scrapping; you can use ``--cache-only`` option.

```sh
php start.php --cache-only
```

### Download specific series
You can either use the Series slug (preferred):
```sh
$ php start.php -s "series-slug-example"
$ php start.php --series-name "series-slug-example"
```
Or the Series name (NOT recommended):
```sh
$ php start.php -s "Series name example"
$ php start.php --series-name "Series name example"
```

### Download specific episodes
You can provide episode number(s) separated by comma ```,```:

```sh
$ php start.php -s "lesson-slug-example" -e "12,15"
$ php start.php --series-name "series-slug-example" --series-episodes "12,15"
```

This will only download episodes which you mentioned in
-e or --series-episodes flag, it will also ignore already downloaded episodes
as usual.

```sh
$ php start.php -s "nuxtjs-from-scratch" -e "12,15" -s "laravel-from-scratch" -e "5"
```

It will download episode 12 and 15 for "nuxtjs-from-scratch" and episode 5 for "laravel-from-scratch" course.

```sh
$ php start.php -s "nuxtjs-from-scratch" -e "12,15" -s "laravel-from-scratch"
```

It will download episode 12 and 15 for "nuxtjs-from-scratch" course and all episodes for "laravel-from-scratch" course.

## Troubleshooting
If you have a `cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain` or `SLL error: cURL error 35` do this:

- Download [http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
- Add `curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem"` to your php.ini

And you are done! If using apache you may need to restart it.
