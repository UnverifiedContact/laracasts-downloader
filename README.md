OR

- Docker

## Installation
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Make a local copy of the `.env` file:
```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```
3. Update your Laracasts account credentials (`EMAIL`, `PASSWORD`) in .env
4. Decide whether you want to use **vimeo** or **laracasts** as `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE`.
   By using Laracasts link you are limited to 30 downloads per day and can't customize video quality.
6. Choose your preferred quality (240p, 360p, 540p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p) by changing **VIDEO_QUALITY** in ``.env``.
   (will be ignored if `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE=laracasts`)
7. Optionally, set **SUB_LANGS** in `.env` to download subtitles (e.g., `SUB_LANGS=en,en-x-autogen`). Only works with `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE=vimeo`.  See [Downloading Subtitles](#downloading-subtitles) for more details.
8. The next steps, choose if you want a [local installation](#using-your-local-machine) or [a Docker based installation](#using-docker) and follow along.

### Details About Vimeo 

If you using vimeo source, will download 2 files for each episode, a video file and an audio file. 

After all download will be done, the project will merge files and will moving to your respective folder. 

### Using your local machine
1. Install project dependencies:
```sh
$ composer install
```
2. To run a download of all content, run the following command:
```sh
$ php start.php
```
3. See [downloading specific series or lessons](#downloading-specific-series-or-lessons) for optional flags.

### Using Docker
1. Build the image:
```sh
$ docker-compose build
```
2. Install project dependencies:
```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm composer
```
3. Then, run the command of your choice as if we were running it locally, but instead against the docker container:
```sh
$ docker-compose run --rm laracastdl php ./start.php [empty for all OR provide flags]
```
4. See [downloading specific series or lessons](#downloading-specific-series-or-lessons) for optional flags.

Also works in the browser, but is better from the cli because of the instant feedback.

## Options

### Disable Scrapping

The script scraps each Laracasts pages and caches them to memories its latest state
and stores them in ``Downloads/cache.php``. If you already make sure this file is updated
and do not want to experience impatience of scrapping; you can use ``--cache-only`` option.

```sh
php start.php --cache-only
```

### Download specific series
You can either use the Series slug (preferred):
```sh
$ php start.php -s "series-slug-example"
$ php start.php --series-name "series-slug-example"
```
Or the Series name (NOT recommended):
```sh
$ php start.php -s "Series name example"
$ php start.php --series-name "Series name example"
```

### Download specific episodes
You can provide episode number(s) separated by comma ```,```:

```sh
$ php start.php -s "lesson-slug-example" -e "12,15"
$ php start.php --series-name "series-slug-example" --series-episodes "12,15"
```

Download from a series with specific subtitles
```sh
$ php start.php -s "inertia-2-unleashed" -l "en,en-x-autogen"
```

This will only download episodes which you mentioned in
-e or --series-episodes flag, it will also ignore already downloaded episodes
as usual.

```sh
$ php start.php -s "nuxtjs-from-scratch" -e "12,15" -s "laravel-from-scratch" -e "5"
```

This will download episode 12 and 15 for "the-definition-series" course and all episodes for "inertia-2-unleashed" course.
```sh
$ php start.php -s "inertia-2-unleashed" -e "12,15" -s "the-definition-series" -l "en,en-x-autogen"
``

## Downloading subtitles

If `SUB_LANGS` is set in the `.env` file then subtitle files (.vtt) will be downloaded for each specified language code alongside the video file.
 The downloader will skip any subtitle which is not available for that video.
 Subtitle downloading is only enabled when `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE=vimeo`.

 Set the `.env` value to try download English subs
```sh
SUB_LANGS=en,en-x-autogen
```

 Codes are separated by commas. You could specify just `en` however because of inconsistent availability, it is probably a good idea to try to grab the autogenerated subtitles for your desired language as well.

You can also specify subtitle languages directly via command line using the `-l` or `--sub-langs` parameter. Doing it this way will ignore the setting in the `.env` file:
```sh
$ php start.php -s "inertia-2-unleashed" -l "en,en-x-autogen,de,de-x-autogen"


#### Example Subtitle codes
```
de              - Deutsch
de-x-autogen    - Deutsch (automatisch generiert)
en              - English
en-x-autogen    - English (auto-generated)
es              - Español
es-x-autogen    - Español (autogenerados)
fr              - Français
hi              - हिन्दी
hi-x-autogen    - हिंदी (ऑटो जनरेटेड)
id-x-autogen    - Bahasa Indonesia (dibuat secara otomatis)
it              - Italiano
ja              - 日本語
ko              - 한국어
pt              - Português
pt-x-autogen    - Português (geradas automaticamente)
ru              - Русский
uk              - Українська
zh              - 中文
```
Subtitles are subject to availability for each video. There may be more codes or fewer available, you'll have to check.

## Downloading subtitles

If `SUB_LANGS` is set in the `.env` file then subtitle files (.vtt) will be downloaded for each specified language alongside the video file.
 The downloader will skip the download of the subtitle when the requested language is not available for that video.
 Subtitle downloading is only enabled when `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE=vimeo`.

 Set the `.env` value to try download English subs
```sh
SUB_LANGS=en
```

Set the `.env` value to try to download English and English autogenerated subs
```sh
SUB_LANGS=en,en-x-autogen
```

You can also specify subtitle languages directly via command line using the `-l` or `--sub-langs` parameter and doing it this way will override the setting in the `.env` file:

```sh
$ php start.php -s "inertia-2-unleashed" -l "en,de"
```

#### Auto-generated subtitles
Auto-generated subtitle files are created using voice analysis software and automatic translations.
For each language, there may be both manual and auto-generated versions available. Auto-generated subtitles have an `-x-autogen` suffix in their language code. 
The availability of a certain type of subtitle can sometimes be inconsistent even in the same series so  it may be a good idea to explicitly specify to try to get both for maximal coverage:
```sh
SUB_LANGS=en,en-x-autogen,de,de-x-autogen
```

## Troubleshooting
If you have a `cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain` or `SLL error: cURL error 35` do this:

- Download [http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
- Add `curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem"` to your php.ini

And you are done! If using apache you may need to restart it.
